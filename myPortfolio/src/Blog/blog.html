                During today’s first day of class, we were introduced to the general uses of HTML and CSS. The main takeaways from today’s lesson that I learned were 1) how to embed images onto a webpage using HTML coding, 2) how to format text by using an external style sheet, and 3) the importance of saving constantly on visual studio code. By using all of these in conjunction, I was able to learn how to create my very first webpage.

                What excites me about coding is the idea that I can combine my passion for creating with my talent in data management. In the past, I have held several positions that involve countless hours of data entry. Although I am by no means terrible at handling data, these positions did not allow me to be creative. By contrast, being able to code enables one access to limitless amounts of possibilities to create something new or unheard of. If I was able to gain a better understanding of programming languages, I could use my newfound abilities to do things like make a new tool to help the environment, make a new video hosting site, or even find revolutionary ways of displaying cat memes. The possibilities are endless.
                
                A doctype is the very first thing used in an HTML document. It is denoted by <!Doctype> and is used to tell the web browser which version of HTML you are using.
                
                There are several ways a browser determines which element matches a CSS selector. The first way is through in-line styling, which will normally be written in the line of code within the HTML coding. The second way is by setting up a style that is used only within a particular page. Finally, the last way is by using an external style sheet that will allow me to type my CSS code separately and use a selector that will match an element in my HTML coding.

                One thing I learned in class today is about the importance of Git and Github. They can be tools for programmers to code as a team effectively, which is instrumental for tackling huge projects. This is accomplished by storing code on Github, and allowing people working together on a project while tracking the changes being made.
                A great workflow to follow when creating a webpage is to plan out the layout by drawing it out. Then you should take the drawing and plan out which way the HTML should be coded. Once you complete what text and images should be included, you can use CSS to improve the aesthetic and look of the webpage. Finally, coding with JavaScript will add interactivity features to the site.
                The Web Accessibility Initiative’s Accessible Rich Internet Applications specification (WAI-ARIA, or just ARIA) is good for bridging areas with accessibility issues that can’t be managed with native HTML.
                A screenreader is an internet tool which allows for people who are blind or visually impaired to be able to interpret what is on a computer screen by reading aloud what the user is browsing. Sometimes HTML cannot be used to specify the semantics, or meaning, of a webpage. ARIA, or Web Accessibility Initiative’s Accessible Rich Internet Applications specification, allows one to specify semantics by modifying the way an element is translated.
